<h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
<p>
    Every variable is stored somewhere in memory. The location of a the
    variable comes in the form of a hexadecimal number called an <b>address</b>.
    (ex. 0x01FA4521) The syntax to get a variable's address is:
    <code>&varName</code>

</p>
<p>
    Variables which can store the addresses of other objects in memory are
    called <b>pointers</b>. Pointers track two things: the address of some
    object in memory, and the type of that object. (We need the type in order to
    use the object later, so this makes sense!)
</p>
<p>
    To create a pointer, we specify the type of the object it is pointing to, as
    well as a special symbol to mark it as a pointer:
    <code>int * myPointerVar;</code>
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, we can "dynamically" create memory. (That is to say, create
    memory without creating an identifier for it) To do so, we use the "new"
    command: <code>new int(10)</code> "new" allocates new memory of some type,
    and we can specify the value of the new memory in paretheses. "new" also
    returns an address, which means we can store the address to that new memory
    in a pointer: <code>int * ptr = new int(42);</code>
</p>
<p>
    Remember that the value of a pointer variable is an address! If you want to
    get the object that a pointer is pointing to, you must use the
    <b>dereference</b> operator(<b>*</b>): <code>cout &lt&lt *ptr;</code>
</p>
<p>
    Arrays are actually just pointers. They store the address of the first
    element of the array. The subscript operator([]) actually just tells us how
    many elements to jump ahead. (This is why the first item is 0, because we
    don't need to jump ahead!) So, we can create arrays using pointers. (And we
    can make those arrays dynamically sized!)
<pre><code>int sizeInt;
cin sizeInt;
int * ptrArr = new int[sizeInt];</code></pre>
</p>
