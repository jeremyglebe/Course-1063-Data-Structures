<h1>Double-Linked List</h1>
<h2>Minor Program 3</h2>
<p>
    <b>tl;dr</b> Students will complete a double-linked list class and will
    create a menu which modifies the list in main.
</p>
<p>
    Students must complete a double-linked list class. (A linked list in which
    the nodes have pointers to the next item and the previous) This linked list
    will contain data of type char. Students are expected to implement the
    following methods:
<ul>
    <li>Constructor and Destructor</li>
    <li>
        <pre>void append(char c);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>void prepend(char c);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>bool remove(char searchKey);</pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Returns true if the key was found and removed</li>
            <li>Returns false if the key was not found</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>void print();</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>void printBackwards();</pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure to make use of double linking here!</li>
            <li>Keeping a pointer to the tail of the list may be helpful as
                well.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Students are welcome to use the code written in class as a starter, but
    methods which can be made more efficient using the double-linking must be
    modified to make use of this feature.
</p>
<p>
    Students may not use implementations written elsewhere, or copy/paste code
    from the internet or other sources.
</p>
<p>
    Students may write the class from scratch if they wish.
</p>
<p>Students will create a menu system in the main() function which allows the
    user to choose to add or remove items from the list. The menu will reprint
    the list after each change.</p>
