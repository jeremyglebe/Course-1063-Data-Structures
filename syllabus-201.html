    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    Introduction to data structures, abstract data types (ADT), recursion, and
    algorithm analysis using a high level language.<br>
    Continuing development of a disciplined approach to program design, coding,
    debugging, and testing.

    <h3>Textbook: Starting Out With C++, Early Objects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Authors:</b> Gaddis, Walters and Muganda</li>
        <li><b>Edition:</b> Recommend 8th or higher.</li>
        <li>
            <b>The textbook is not required to pass the class,
                nor is it required to obtain assignments,</b>
            but it is useful and contains an immense amount of references and examples.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software</h3>
    <b>Visual Studio is recommended
        and it is available to MSU students free of charge.</b>
    <br>However, as we will not be studying any libraries specific to Visual C++ or
    Windows, students may use other tools if desired.
    <br>On that note, students writing (or copying from online) obscure, compiler
    dependent code is discouraged and may impact grades.

    <h3>Hardware</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Students will need access to a computer</b>
            but there are some available in the labs if you do not have one.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If you do not have a computer of your own,</b>
            make sure to pay attention to the lab's hours! Lab hours will not
            be an excuse for late work.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If you are working from a personal computer,</b> you should
            know that chromebooks are not supported well by D2L/Brightspace.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Students should also have access to a printer and paper.</b>
            These are also available in several of MSU's computer labs. See above
            note on lab hours.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    If I do not respond to an email within 24 hours,
    <b>email me again.</b>
    I'm a busy person, as I am also a full time student, but you have paid for my time!
    If I don't respond immediately, I probably just missed the email, send me a follow-up.

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There will be multiple opportunities to earn extra credit during the semester. These opportunities may
            be events, such as ACM meetings, or additional assigments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each extra credit opportunity will earn 1 point for the student's extra credit & participation grade
        </li>
        <li>
            A maximum of 5 points can be earned for extra credit and participation
        </li>
        <li>
            A point for participation may be earned in class for student's overall contributions and efforts. This
            will be determined at the end of the semester.
        </li>
        <li>
            Extra credit and participation grades serve as a method to "round" your grade. If you have an 85, extra
            credit could be the difference between a B and an A.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Attendance is not a component of the course grade.
        </li>
        <li>
            The student will be subject to any attendance requirements
            specified by the department or university.
        </li>
        <li>
            Students are responsible for material or assignments that they miss.
        </li>
        <li>
            Exceptions will be provided with university excused absences and may be
            otherwise provided by the instructor with reasonable documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is impossible to earn participation credit if a student is not
            present, meaning that attendance may have an indirect impact on a
            student's final grade.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Programming Assignments</h3>
    For all programming assignments, but especially Major Programs, I expect:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Programs must always compile. Students have access to compilers on lab computers, there
            is no excuse for this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Programs must not crash on reasonable inputs. I'm not demanding a bug-free program,
            only that I can run enough of it to grade without crashing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Failure to meet these conditions will result in severe grade penalties. (20% minimum) A few
    pieces of advice:
    <ol>
        <li>
            If your program is not compiling, you can always ask the instructor or tutors for help.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even if your program is incomplete in terms of features, make sure it runs! I'll give
            partial credit for incomplete programs, but they still need to compile and run.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is better to turn in an assignment 1 or 2 days late than to give me a program which
            does not compile.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Final Exam</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Our final exam will be Wednesday, April 28th at 3:30PM-5:30PM in our
            regular classroom.
        </li>
        <li>
            There will not be an opportunity to make up the final exam.
            <b>Do not miss it.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            In the event of a university excused absence, the student's final grade
            will be calculated from their current average.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Late work will be accepted for up to a week after an assignment is
            due or at the instructor's discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignments turned in late incur a 10% penalty immediately. For each
            additional day the assignment is not turned it, it will incur a 5% penalty.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Department Policies</h2>

    <h3>Policy on Academic Honesty</h3>
    The Department of Computer Science had adopted the following policy
    related to cheating (academic misconduct). The policy will be applied to all instances of
    cheating on assignments and exams as determined by the instructor of the course.
    <ul>
        <li>
            1st instance of cheating in a course: The student will be assigned a non-replaceable grade of zero for the
            assignment, project or exam. In addition, the student will receive a one letter grade reduction in course.
        </li>
        <li>
            2nd instance of cheating in a course: The student will receive a grade of F in course & immediately be
            removed
            from course.
        </li>
        <li>
            All instances of cheating will be reported to the Department Chair and, in the case of graduate students, to
            the
            Department Graduate Coordinator.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing Policy</h3>
    The Department of Computer Science has adopted the following policy related to testing.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            All bags, purses, electronics (turned off), books, etc. will be placed in the front of the room during
            exams, or
            in an area designated by the instructor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unless otherwise announced by the instructor, nothing is allowed on the desk but pen/pencil/eraser and test
            papers.
        </li>
        <li>
            You are not allowed to leave the classroom. Please take this seriously and into consideration before any
            test
            and the final. Prepare yourself to be in the classroom during the entire exam.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you decide to leave the classroom during a test and/or the final exam, your exam will be collected, and
            you
            will not be allowed to continue.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>University Policies</h2>

    <h3>Classroom Civility</h3>
    All violations of classroom civility will be reported to the Dean of Students. Students are
    expected to assist in maintaining a classroom environmentthat is conducive to learning. In order
    to ensure that all students gain from time spent in class, students are prohibited from engaging
    in any form of distraction, e.g. leaving the room for extended periods of time, reading
    newspapers (or other articles), working on other courses, and using cell-phones or laptops for
    calls or messages. If you indulge in any such inappropriate behavior (without explicit consent of
    the instructor), you will (at the very least) be asked to leave the classroom.
    <a href="https://msutexas.edu/student-life/dean/">MSU Dean of Students Website.</a>

    <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
    Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the
    course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make any necessary
    arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from disability support office
    during the instructor’s office hours. Please note instructors are not allowed to provide
    classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification from Disability Support
    Office has been provided. For additional information you may contact the Disability Support
    Office in Clark Student Center 168 -Phone: (940) 397-4140.
    <a href="https://msutexas.edu/student-life/disability/">Disability Support Services.</a>

    <h3>Dean of Students</h3>
    The Dean of Students can assist in notifying the campus community of student illnesses,
    immediate family deaths and/or student death. Generally, in cases of student illness or
    immediate family deaths, the notification to the appropriate campus community members occur
    when a student is absent from class for four consecutive days with appropriate verification. It
    is the student's responsibility for missed class assignments and/or course work during their
    absence.
    <a href="https://msutexas.edu/student-life/dean/">MSU Dean of Students Website.</a>

    <h3>Campus Carry</h3>
    Senate Bill 11 passed by the 84th Texas Legislature allows licensed handgun holders to carry
    concealed handguns on campus, effective August 1, 2016. Areas excluded from concealed carry are
    appropriately marked, in accordance with state law. For more information regarding campus carry,
    please refer to the University’s webpage at
    <a href="https://msutexas.edu/campus-carry/index">Campus Carry.</a>

    <h3>University COVID-19 Policy</h3>

                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Recording of Class Lectures</h3>
    Permission must be requested in writing and obtained from the instructor before recording of class lectures.
    If permission is granted, the recording may only be used by the student making the recording. Recordings
    (or any class materials) may NOT be posted on any internet source without written permission of the
    instructor. Failure to adhere to the policy may result in removal from the course with a grade of F or
    other appropriate punishment.

    <h3>Midterm Progress Report</h3>
    In order to help students keep track of their progress toward course objectives, the instructor for this
    class will provide a Midterm Progress Report for all students in the course through each student’s WebWorld
    account. Midterm grades will not be reported on the students’ transcript; nor will they be calculated in
    the cumulative GPA. They simply give students an idea of where they stand at the midpoint of the semester.
    Students earning below a C at the midway point should a) schedule a meeting with the professor and
    b) Seek out tutoring.
