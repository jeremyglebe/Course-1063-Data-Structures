<h3>Alternative Major 2 Assignment (for a Maximum of 85% credit)</h3>

<p>Students will create a program which takes the user through an interactive
    “book”. It should print the text of the pages to the screen using cout and
    also provide the user with some choices of what to do. The program will
    obtain the user’s choice through cin. The story should contain a happy
    ending that the user wishes to find, as well as a bad ending (such as “you
    died!”) that the user wishes to avoid. The user should be able to return to
    the previous page at any time.</p>

<p>Represent the book using an array of strings. These strings should contain
    prompts instructing the user what pages to continue to based on their
    decisions. Example:
    "The gigantic minotaur charges at you head on! Go to page 8 to jump away. Go
    to page 10 to wrestle the minotaur."
</p>

<p>The user can enter any page number (array index) in response to these
    strings. They will then be shown the new page they have chosen. There is no
    enforcement of page choice. (If the string says to go to page 8 or 10, and
    the user enters page 99, they will go to page 99)</p>

<p>That said, you should make sure the user's page choice is within the bounds
    of the array. (If the array has 30 pages, they can't choose index 40)</p>

<p>You should keep track of the pages the user has visited in a stack, and they
    should be able to go back a page by entering -1.</p>

<p><b>The only class you need to write for this program is a Stack. The rest can
        be done without classes or with any existing structures the programmer
        wishes to use.</b></p>

<p>In addition to the above requirements, I expect students to include their own
    unique and interesting ideas into the program. Students should include at
    least one additional feature of their choice to make their book more
    interesting.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble coming up with something, my recommendation is some
    sort of persistent variable that is used throughout the book. For instance,
    before starting into the book you could prompt the user for their favorite
    color. Then, using a string variable, the book could later describe
    something as being their favorite color. (Ex. “The flower was a beautiful
    shade of [user’s favorite color]”)</p>

<p>Students cannot use the exact feature (favorite color) I described as their
    unique idea. It was just an example. Students are welcome to include it in
    their book if they really want to, but I’d like for students to come up with
    their own as well.</p>

<p>Students will be working in groups of two for this assignment. In industry
    and in other classes, students may find themselves working on very large
    projects in fairly large groups. Working in pairs, students will start to
    learn how to work collaboratively in a programming context. However, each
    student is ultimately responsible for the outcome of their own grade. If
    there are issues with group assignments, let me know early. Students may be
    allowed to work on their own after talking to me.</p>
