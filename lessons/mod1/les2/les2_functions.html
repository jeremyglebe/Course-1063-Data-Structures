<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    To <b>call</b> a function is to make it execute. A function
    <b>definition</b> is the statements that make up the function's behavior.
    Every function has an <b>identifier</b>, <b>parameters</b>, a <b>body</b>,
    and a <b>return type</b>
</p>
<p>
    Identifiers work the same way as they do with variables. The identifier you
    define for your function will be used to access it at other points in your
    program.
</p>
<p>
    Parameters are variables which may be sent to a function and should affect
    the results of the function. Parameters define the type of data sent to the
    function, whereas the actual values you choose to send it for any given call
    are called <b>arguments</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The body of the function is the group of statements found inside the
    function's curled braces. <code>{ }</code> This makes up the bulk of the
    function definition and it's behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Functions can send back a variable to the location they were called from.
    This is called a return. The return type, specified in the function
    definition, is the type of variable that the function must return. If the
    function does not return a variable, we make it's return type <b>void</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Function prototypes are one-line previews of the definition. They let the
    compiler know what the function will look like, but do not include it's
    body. The full function, with it's body, must then be defined later. This
    is particularly useful if you have very long functions and do not want to
    put them at the top of your file because they would "hide"
    <code>main()</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Overloaded functions are functions which share an identifer, but do not
    share the same type of parameters. The compiler understands that these
    functions are different, because it actually stores a "signature" internally
    for every function, which is a combination of both the identifier and list
    of parameters. When using overloaded functions, the compiler will determine
    which function you intend to use based on the arguments you pass.
</p>
<p>
    It is very important to remember that the compiler expects different types
    of parameters, not just differently named parameters. In addition, changing
    the return type will not allow you to overload a function, it will only
    cause errors. Overloaded functions must have different <i>parameter
        types</i>, always.
