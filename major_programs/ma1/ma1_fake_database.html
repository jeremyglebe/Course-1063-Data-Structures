<h1>Searchable "Database"</h1>
<h2>Major Program 1</h2>
<p>
    <b>tl;dr</b> Students' programs will read in some dataset and store records
    of items in the dataset. Then, users will be able to enter some key value of
    the records and display the full item. (If it is found)
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Students will works in pairs for this assignment. Only one student
        should turn it in and both students' names should be in a comment block
        at the top of the program.
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Students will define their own input files. The input needs to be some large
    dataset with numerous records. Students are welcome to use my
    <code>pokemon.dat</code> file for convenience. It describes Pokemon from the
    video game series Pokemon. Regardless of what data file they use, students
    need to explain to me the format of their data in a comment block at the top
    of the program.
<p>
<p>
    Students' programs will read in all the records and store them in an array.
</p>
<p>
    Students' programs will then prompt the user to enter a search key. Which
    value is the search key is arbitrary, but try to pick one that makes sense
    to search by. Example: If I was using the Pokemon dataset, I would probably
    make the search use names.
</p>
<p>
    The program MUST be able to do multiple searches without closing. While
    loops are your friend. To "refresh" between searches (keeps the screen from
    getting too cluttered) just print a bunch of new lines.
    <br><code>cout &lt&lt string(300, '\n');</code>
</p>
<p>
    Student's should try to make their program intuitive and somewhat visual.
    Ex: A title card could be printed at the start of the program and before
    results. Students should make it clear how to exit the program.
</p>
<p>
    This program is intentionally not very guided. It is a major program and I
    expect creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving from students.
</p>

<h3>Topics Required</h3>
To complete this assignment, students will need to understand C++ structs and
arrays.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Students completing this assignment will have demonstrated knowledge of structs,
which is critical to the rest of the course. Students will also have started to
investigate searching, which will be a major topic later in our algorithms
section.
