<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Note on terminology: One term often treated as synonymous with structs is
    <b>record</b>. While these are technically separate things, it is very
    common to use structs to represent records. (Which are a more abstract
    concept)
</p>
<p>
    Records can contain arrays. When defining a struct we need only include a
    data member of the array type. Elements of the array are then accessed
    (somewhat intuitively) like so:
<pre><code>MyStructType record;
record.arrayMember[INDEX] = SOME_VALUE; // Where INDEX is an int</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the type of objects an array holds can be records/structs. They
    are declared the same as normal, but with the struct's type name.
    Ex: <code>MyStructType fancyArray[1000];</code> The way you would then
    access the records data members is like so:
    <code>fancyArray[INDEX].someDataMember = SOME_VALUE;</code>
</p>
<p>
    For a quick experiment in giving yourself a headache, consider the following
    defined types and variables.
<pre><code>struct MyType {
    int things[100];
    string stuff;
};
// Later on, somewhere in main() or another function
MyType ohNoArray[1000];
// Now, to access array elements inside a MyType object...
ohNoArray[10].things[94] = 0;
</code></pre>
Now the good news. You likely won't have to do anything like that for awhile. I
just wanted to expose you to how crazy the syntax can get at times. Sorry to
scare you.
