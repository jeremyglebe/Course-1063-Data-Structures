<h1>Happy New Years!</h1>
<h3>We're all a little relieved to be done with 2020, right?</h3>
So, I know most of you are currently enjoying your break and will not see this
news item for a little while longer. But for those of you who, like me, can't
help but check D2L occasionally: I am wishing you well and hope you enjoy the
rest of your break. I look forward to meeting you all.<br>

<br><i>I am currently working on setting things up on D2L for the upcoming
    semester, so expect a lot of changes to our page before the actual start of
    the semester.</i>
